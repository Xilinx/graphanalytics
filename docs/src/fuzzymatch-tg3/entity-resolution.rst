Entity Resolution
=================

Entity resolution is an operational intelligence process, whereby organizations 
can connect disparate data sources with a view to understanding possible entity 
matches and non-obvious relationships across multiple data silos. It analyzes 
all of the information relating to individuals and/or entities from multiple 
sources of data, and then applies likelihood and probability scoring to determine 
which identities are a match and what, if any, non-obvious relationships 
exist between those identities.

This use case shows hows how a TigerGraph-based application can leverage Xilinx 
FuzzyMatch plugin to achieve order of magnitude speedup in entity resolution.
