Supply Chain Optimization
=========================

Supply chain is a critical part of any business dealing with inventory and movement 
of products. Any business has limited amount of resources that needs to be used in 
an optimal way to maximize profit margins. In the case of supply chain management, 
trips need to be scheduled to perform deliveries/pick ups. As such, resources and trips 
can be modeled with a graph and the problem of optimizing the supply chain can be 
modeled as an maximal independent set (MIS) problem.

AMD Supply Chain Optimization product based on MIS has shown great acceleration on
AMD Alveo cards.
