Xilinx Maximal Independent Set Alveo Product Overview
=====================================================

An independent set of a graph is a subset of vertices in which no two vertices 
are adjacent. Given a set of vertices, the maximum independent set problem (MIS) 
calls for finding the independent set of maximum cardinality. There are many 
applications that require finding the MIS, including but not limited to the following:

* Massive data sets: military systems, telecommunications, medicine, finance, etc.
* Coding theory: formulating error correction codes
* Ad-hoc wireless networks: search and rescue operations, battlefield decisions, 
addressing battery and security issues, etc.
