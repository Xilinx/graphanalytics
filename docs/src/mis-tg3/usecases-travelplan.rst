Supply Chain Travel Plan
========================

Supply chain is a critical part of any business dealing with inventory and movement of products. Any business has
limited amount of resources that needs to be used in an optimal way to maximize profit margins. In the case of supply
chain management, trips need to be scheduled to perform deliveries/pick ups. As such, resources and trips can be
modeled with a graph and the problem of optimizing the supply chain can be modeled as an MIS problem.

This example shows hows how a TigerGraph-based application can leverage Xilinx Maximal Independent Set TigerGraph
3.x.
