Use cases
-----------------------------------------

Cosine similarity can be used to but not limited to the following use cases:

Patient Similarity
********************
Health and medical professionals are required to make predictions for diagnosis 
and prognosis in various medical problems. Individualized predictive analytics 
based on patient similarity is becoming popular in this field to identify similar 
patients to an index patient, derive insights from the records of the similar 
patients, and provide personalized predictions. Studies have shown that cosine 
similarity metrics can outperform conventional predictive modeling in which all 
available patient data are analyzed. The improved prediction performance is 
achieved at the cost of increased computational burden. 

Xilinx Graph Analytics library optimized for 
`Alveo Adaptable Accelerator Cards <https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo.html>`_ 
has been demonstrated on `Synthea <https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea/>`_ generated 
patient data to greatly reduce that computational burden and provide predication results 
for patients more rapidly. Synthea is an open-source, synthetic patient 
generator that models the medical history of synthetic patients and provides high-quality, 
synthetic, realistic but not real, patient data and associated health records covering 
every aspect of healthcare.
