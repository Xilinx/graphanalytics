    "# Welcome to Xilinx Cosine Similarity Acceleration Demo \n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**This Notebook demonstrates how to use the Xilinx Cosine Similarity product and shows the power of Xilinx FPGAs to accelerate Cosine Similarity**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Demo : Drug Similarity \n",
    "\n",
    "In this Demo Example, we will try to find similar Drugs/Healthcare terms from the [Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/quickstart.html) Dataset. UMLS is a collection of health and biomedical vocabularies from a wide variety of Healthcare data sources. One of the knowledge source in UMLS is a [Metathesaurus](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/knowledge_sources/metathesaurus/index.html) that is a collection of medical concepts called <b>atoms</b> and links them through useful relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this demo, we use a small subset of the <b>atoms</b> file <I>MRCONSO.RRF</I> and use relationships between atoms from the relationships file <I>MRREL.RRF</I>. The atoms and their relations are modeled as a graph database using [TigerGraph Enterprise Database](https://www.tigergraph.com/) and [Cosine Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) is used as the match similarity measure. Xilinx Cosine Similarity library is used to accelerate the similarity score computation by offloading to [Xilinx Alveo U50](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u50.html) FPGA cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each atom is converted into an embedding representation by probabilistically capturing their relations. We use the [Node2Vec](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-platform-overview/graph-algorithm-library#node-2-vec) algorithm to compute embeddings for each atom vertex in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Example selects a random vertex in the graph as the query and filters out the UMLS Database and returns the Top Matching similar drugs, drug ingredients or related healthcare concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In General, finding Cosine Similarity on large datasets take a large amount of time on CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Xilinx Cosine Similarity Acceleration, speedups > ~ 80x can be achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the Xilinx Cosine Similarity in the backend and setup a Drug Database against which similarity of target vectors can be calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "### The Demo is Structured into Seven Sections :\n",
