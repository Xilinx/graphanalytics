    "This notebook uses [pyTigerGraph](https://pytigergraph.github.io/pyTigerGraph/), a TigerGraph python interface to calculate similarity using Xilinx FPGAs. The python package uses a Java client to run gsql queries on a remote server running TigerGraph via Rest APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The demo\n",
    "For the purpose of this demo, we will use medical data synthetically generated using an open-source tool called [Synthea](https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea/) to find patients that are the most \"similar\" to a particular patient based on a list of attributes. The similarity score used is Cosine Similarity. For more information, refer to [Xilinx Alveo Graph Analytics](https://pages.gitenterprise.xilinx.com/FaaSApps/graphanalytics/index.html) doc. The demo is structured in two sections. Before proceeding, we configure the demo with the following setup steps.\n",
    " \n",
    "> **NOTE 1**: The synthea data is for demonstration purpose only and the user can use their own data and write queries to create their own embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **NOTE 2**: The TigerGraph plugin currently used to run queries on FPGA supports only one graph. Therefore, more than one concurrent users running this demo on the same TG server is not supported. This will be supported in a future version."
